               The level you choose means that when someone falls on your top 2 posistions whether you bring them in, someone above you, or you have someone in our marketing market for you those 2
               payments go to your sponsor.
               When the same thing happens for them or 4 more spots get filled under you.
               You instantly make 4 payments in the system. This happens for each level
               whether you brought the person in, the system, or you received spillover from above.
               <br><br>
               Each level purchases ad credits you receive a 100% commission immediately when your bottom 4 spots get filled Paid IN BTC (OR HOWEVER YOU LIKE)Daily!
               We recommend you start at the highest level you can because you will make money faster. You get paid directly. The value depends on the level. All levels are seperate and you can only get paid on the level you are on. If you are not on that level the
               payment passes up to your sponsor.
               <br><br>
               When you purchase a level a matrix is formed. A matrix has 4 pay positions and to create more you must re-enter. Your people follow you over and over and can re-enter on your next available matrix spot unlimited times.
               On the 7th payment if you have not re-entered and purchased a new matrix (level) the sale will spillover to your downline.
               <br><br>
               Once you receive 4 payments you must re-enter the level again to open up a new set of 4 pay positions (matrix). This is called cycling. It is how you make money over and over again and create a massive leverage pipeline.
               <br><br>
               You can invite as many people as you like and they pay you as long as you have open positions. This includes free rotator sales, spillover, and the system has a done for you marketing team that will market for you.There is also a blueprint made from successful members that will show you exactly what to do each day. That means even if you
               receive one payment, if that person cycles they will PAY YOU AGAIN and go under your next available spot again and again as long as you have spots available.
               <br><br>
               Be careful which level you choose because when the system is ready to give you a sale that is the amount you will receive up to 4 times!
               You will make more when you choose the highest level you can because people will do what you do.
               <br><br>
               That means you can double, triple, or quadruple your bitcoin in 30 days without recruiting if you qualify.
               <br><br>
               Income Disclaimer: Results are not typical. They are based on your efforts. Remember you can also get spillover sales.
